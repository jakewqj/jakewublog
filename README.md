# Blog from Jake Wu - jakewu.net
This repo contains the blog from Jake Wu, both the blog application as well as the blog data.</p>
Iâ€™ve been trying to created a blog experimenting between jekyll and hexo. This one is created based on jekyll.</p>
The blog is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. Blog posts are written in Markdown. The following technologies are used:</p>

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), Liquid and Ruby
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and GitHub Actions
- [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
